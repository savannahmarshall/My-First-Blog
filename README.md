The purpose of this project was to create a two page website where users can input and view blog posts. On the first page, there are three text boxes that ask the user to input their username, blog post title and blog post content. There must be an entry written in each box, otherwise you will see a prompt below the submit button explaining that they cannot be blank. Once all boxes have information entered in them, you can select submit. This will take you to the next page where you will see your blog posts displayed with each post being in it's own box. If you right click, select inspect, and view the localStorage window, you will see a JSON array of the inputs that were entered on the first page. In addition, if you click on the sun icon in the top middle of the page, you can change the background from dark to light. 

While completing this project, I learned how to transfer data from one page to another using localStorage and JavaScript. This was something that was a challenge for me to figure out because there are multiple components and none of the elements will work properly if there is a mistake in the code. I also learned how to create an interactive photo that will change the background of the page to both dark and light when you click on it. In addition, I learned how to create a prompt using JavaScript and create buttons that will toggle between two webpages.
