The purpose of this project was to create a two page website where users can input and view blog posts. On the first page, there are three text boxes that ask the user to input their username, blog post title and blog post content. There must be an entry written in each box, otherwise you will see a prompt below the submit button explaining that they cannot be blank. Once all boxes have information entered in them, you can select submit. This will take you to the next page where you will see your blog posts displayed
